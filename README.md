# Predicting-College-Basketball-Conference-Champions

Our project centers around NCAA Conference Champions, where 32 automatic bids are granted to the
winners of each of the 32 conference tournaments. Our primary focus is on the Power 6 conferences—Big
10, Pac 12, ACC, Big East, SEC, and Big 12—since these conferences typically produce teams that reach
the National Championship game. Although the Power 6 conferences are usually multiple bid
conferences, securing the regular season conference title enhances a team's chances in the tournament by
securing a better seed. Our objective is to analyze how different play-styles influence success in these
different conferences and impact who will be crowned the conference champion. We also wanted to look
at what factors lead to conference success with all the teams combined because we believe that these
overall factors can lead to having success in the NCAA tournament after the conference championships.


We utilize datasets created by Torvik, offering insights into teams' year-long performance and preseason
rankings from 2008 to 2023, providing fans with predictions about their team's potential success. By predicting conference
championship winners, we aim to anticipate automatic bids, granting teams entry into the tournament and
a shot at the National Championship. The focus on Power 6 conferences aligns with the majority of fans'
support, fostering increased engagement throughout the season by providing accurate information about
their teams.
